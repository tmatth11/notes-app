This repository contains the code for a front-end note-taking application written in React and styled with Bootstrap. Users have the ability to create, edit, and/or download their own notes right in the browser. The notes will be saved through local storage and appended to the home screen after the user clicks the "Save Note" button. You can view the site live at <a href="https://notes-app-bx3d.onrender.com/" target="_blank">this link</a>.
